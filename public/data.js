            "Dana is a passionate adaptive athlete, storyteller, and co-founder of Adaptive Impact. Diagnosed with a motor neuron disease in 2023, she chose to live louder, freer, and bolder than ever. Her journey from subtle symptoms to full-time mobility challenges hasn’t grounded her — it’s lifted her.",
            "Through paragliding, skiing, and other adaptive adventures, Dana discovered something powerful: freedom from her diagnosis. In those moments, she felt strong, alive, and limitless — and that freedom sparked a mission to help others feel it too.",

            "With courage, humor, and an unyielding drive to live life to the fullest, Dana co-created Adaptive Impact to help others with mobility limitations reclaim movement, adventure, and joy — not despite the obstacles, but through them.",
